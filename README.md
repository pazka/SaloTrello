# Salome's Academic Aerie

I'm trying to make a satisfying modelisation of all of the archived task of salome's thesis by exploiting her Trello data. 

The goal is for me to try my hand at 3D modeling (with the generous help of [React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)) and perfecting my API fetching already started in the [ThesisTrelloMapper](https://github.com/pazka/ThesisTrelloMapper of Alessia Sanna Thesis Logbook).
